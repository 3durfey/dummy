The aim of the assignments in your philosophy classes
is to get you doing philosophy. But what is philosophy,
and how is it to be done? The answer is complicated.
Philosophers are often motivated by one or more of what
we might call the “Big Questions,” such as: How should
we live? Is there free will? How do we know anything?
or, What is truth? While philosophers do not agree among
themselves on either the range of proper philosophical
questions or the proper methods of answering them, they
do agree that merely expressing one’s personal opinions
on controversial topics like these is not doing philosophy.
Rather, philosophers insist on the method of first attaining
clarity about the exact question being asked, and then
providing answers supported by clear, logically structured
arguments.
